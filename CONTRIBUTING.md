## üèóÔ∏è Development Guidelines

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/aws-ec2-quorumstop.git
cd aws-ec2-quorumstop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-voting-algorithm

# Make changes and test
# ... develop and test your changes ...

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: add weighted voting algorithm for team leads"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/new-voting-algorithm
```

Replace <your-username> in the clone URL with your GitHub username when contributing from a fork.

### Testing Your Changes

**Client-Side Testing (Windows):**
```batch
REM Test all batch scripts
test_aws.bat
view_config.bat
start_server.bat
shutdown_server.bat
```

**Server-Side Testing (Linux):**
```bash
# Test server script functionality
./vote_shutdown.sh debug
./vote_shutdown.sh help
./vote_shutdown.sh status

# Test voting scenarios
./vote_shutdown.sh initiate 203.0.113.10  # Simulate vote
```

**Integration Testing:**
1. Set up test EC2 instance
2. Test full workflow from Windows client to server
3. Test various voting scenarios
4. Verify error handling

### Code Style Guidelines

**Batch Scripts (.bat files):**
```batch
@echo off
REM Use clear, descriptive comments
REM Follow existing patterns for consistency

REM Use meaningful variable names
set MEANINGFUL_NAME=value

REM Handle errors appropriately
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo ERROR: Descriptive error message
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

REM Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
echo This is a reasonably short line that fits well
```

**Bash Scripts (.sh files):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Use clear, descriptive comments
# Follow existing patterns for consistency

# Use meaningful variable names
meaningful_name="value"

# Handle errors appropriately
if ! command_that_might_fail; then
    echo "ERROR: Descriptive error message" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Use proper quoting
echo "Variables should be quoted: $meaningful_name"
```

**Documentation (.md files):**
- Use clear, concise language
- Follow existing formatting patterns
- Include code examples where helpful
- Add screenshots for complex UI interactions
- Keep lines under 120 characters

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer description if needed

Fixes #123
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, etc.

**Examples:**
```
feat(voting): add weighted voting for team leads

Allow team leads to have double weight in voting decisions.
This helps prevent situations where junior developers
accidentally shutdown production systems.

Fixes #45

fix(client): handle spaces in SSH key file paths

Windows paths with spaces were causing SSH connection failures.
Now properly quote the key file path in all SSH commands.

Fixes #78

docs(readme): update installation instructions

Add troubleshooting section for common Windows path issues
and improve clarity of AWS CLI setup steps.
```
